Enables response/mobile-friendly text-based tooltip/commentary popups.

== Description ==

This adds a responsive and mobile-friendly tooltip popup in the vein of
[this article](http://osvaldas.info/elegant-css-and-jquery-tooltip-responsive-mobile-friendly). For an example (and an explanation why), please read
the [introductory article](http://terrychay.com/article/this-is-my-tooltip.shtml).

You can add a textual tooltip to anything simply by adding a `rel="tooltip"`
and a `title` attribute with the tooltip content, just like you'd expect with
regular HTML. It also supports shortcodes to generate them. Use the following
shortcode:
`[commentary text="TOOLTIP TEXT HERE"]TARGET HTML HERE[/commentary]`

For backward compatibility reasons, any tags with `class="commentary" title="tooltip"` are similarly enabled.

== Installation ==

See ["Installing Plugins" article on the WP Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)

Once installed and activated, there's nothing more you need to do (though you
can use filters in your themes `functions.php` to change the behaviors)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
